<div>
	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>I created this as a spreadsheet after getting frustrated with the lack of available info on what was the most efficient usage of my worm farms, and it spiralled from there.</p>
	<p>A website running Sveltekit on Vercel to display tables with the most time efficient way to earn gold using worm farms, seed collectors, and preserves jars.</p>
	<p>Needs significant updating as of patch 0.169.0 due to changes in backend numbers.</p>
